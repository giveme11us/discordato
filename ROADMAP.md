## Phase 6: Maintenance & Monitoring

### 6.1 Monitoring System
- Add health checks:
  - Bot status
  - API connectivity
  - Database status
- Implement metrics collection:
  - Command usage
  - Error rates
  - Response times

### 6.2 Maintenance Tools
- Create maintenance scripts:
  - Database backup
  - Log rotation
  - Configuration backup
- Add cleanup utilities:
  - Cache cleanup
  - Temporary file cleanup
  - Database maintenance

## Implementation Order

1. ✅ Phase 2: Code Quality Improvements (Completed)
2. ✅ Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (Completed)
3. ✅ Phase 4: Documentation (Completed)
4. Implement security and performance improvements in Phase 5
5. Finally, add maintenance and monitoring in Phase 6

## Notes
- Each phase should be completed before moving to the next
- Each task should include proper testing
- All changes should be documented
- Regular backups should be maintained throughout the process
- Changes should be implemented in small, manageable chunks
- Each change should be reviewed before implementation
